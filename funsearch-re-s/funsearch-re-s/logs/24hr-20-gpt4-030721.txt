    The function that determine the priority should be generated by LLM, but with an improvement over version 0 where the greatest
    number of points doens't necessarily mean the highest priority.

    Logic behind v1:
    - If multiple tasks can cover the same number of points, their prioritisation will depend on their index,
      meaning tasks with higher index will have greater priority.
    - If there are tasks that do not cover any point, they will not be prioritised over those that can cover at least a point.

The tuple is likely to be empty, and if so, it means that the corresponding task cannot cover any point. The dict is sorted in ascending order on the number of points that can be covered.
