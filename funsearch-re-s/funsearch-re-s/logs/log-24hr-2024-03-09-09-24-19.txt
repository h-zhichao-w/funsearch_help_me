    An improved and more complex function to determine the priority of tasks for allocation.
    This version uses a multi-criteria decision-making process, considering not only the coverage 
    but also the strategic importance and the urgency of tasks.

    Args:
        sorted_combinations: dict, sorted combinations of task id and its coverage along with strategic 
        importance and urgency. The key is a tuple, format: [index of satellite, index of pass, index of task],

        importance is an integer, and urgency is an integer indicating how urgent the task is (higher means more urgent).

        tuple[int, int, int], the combination that is prioritized, format: [satellite index, pass index, task index].
