    """
    Improved version of `priority_v0`. Prioritise tasks based on the coverage and also their index. The later the index, the higher the priority.

    Args:
        sorted_combinations: dict, sorted combinations of task id and its coverage. The key is a tuple, in the format of [index of satellite, index of pass, index of task], and the value is a tuple, containing the indices of points that can be covered by the task. The tuple is likely to be empty, and if so, it means that the corresponding task cannot cover any point. The dict is sorted in ascending order on the number of points that can be covered.

    Returns:
        tuple[int, int, int], the combination that is prioritised,
        in the format of [satellite index, pass index, task index], i.e. the key of the prioritised task.
